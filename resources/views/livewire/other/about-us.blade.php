                        The Zambia University College of Technology (ZUT) formerly Zambia ICT College / Zamtel College is the fastest-growing higher learning institution based in Ndola. The University College is a government higher institution of learning and ICT Centre of Excellence.

                        In May 2022, Zambia Information and Communication Technology College has declared a Public Higher Education Institution and renamed as Zambia University College of Technology through the Statutory Instrument No.13 of 2022 and the Higher Education Act No, 4 of 2013.

                            The Institution was officially opened in 1972 by Fwanyanga Mulikita the then Minister of Power, Transport and Communication. It was constructed with the help of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), to provide in-service training for staff and the region. However, over the years, the institution evolved from just offering in-service training to diverse programs ranging from telecommunication courses to professional accountancy and business programs.

                        In the year 2010, the parent company Zamtel was privatized which resulted into the separation and handover of the college to ZICTA as caretaker. Later, in 2014, the government decided to transfer full ownership and control of the college to ZICTA with a view to transforming it into a National ICT Centre of Excellence and become the Talent Training Centre within the SMART ZAMBIA project.

                   The transition has seen the change of names from Zamtel Training College to Zambia ICT College and now Zambia University College of Technology.
                   The College is taking advantage of the 1998 TEVET Act No 13 to respond to the key stakeholder demands, create links and innovative partnerships with other training providers, industry, and business to ensure that training programs are actively interfaced with workplace learning and entrepreneurship development.
